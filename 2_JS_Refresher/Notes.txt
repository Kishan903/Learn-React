2) Let vs Const
var, let, const
let - variable values
const - constant values

3) Arrow functions

normal function
function myFunction(){
    ...
}

arrow function 
const myFunction = () => {
    ...
}

example 
const myName = (name) => {
    console.log(name);
}

myName("Kishan")

alternatives

one argument
const myName = name => {
    console.log(name);
}

no arguments 
const myName = () => {
    console.log("Kishan")
}
#in above empty braces is mandatory

if you have more than one argument you also need paranthesis
conse myName = (name, age) = {
    console.log(name, age)
}

lot of function just return something in this case
single line return
const multiply = number => number * 2;

4) Exports and Imports(Modules)

Exports

In Person.js
const person = () => {
    name: 'Max'
}
export default person

In utility.js
export const clean = () = {...}
export const baseData = 10;

app.js
import person from './person.js' #here we can give any name in the default export
import prs from './person.js' #here we can give any name in the defualt export

import {baseData} from './utility.js' # here we have to give the same name in simple export with curly braces
import {clean} from './utility.js' # here we have to give the same name in simple export with curly braces

you can also use alias in the name export
import {baseData as bd} from './utility.js'
also you can export everything like this
import * as bundled from './utility.js'
bundled is an object you can use from bundled like this
bundled.clean or bundled.baseData
